## Task 1

Study the basic constructs and concepts discussed in the lesson.

## Task 2

Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template.

Requirements:
- Describe a structure named `Train` with the following fields:
  - destination,
  - train number,
  - departure time.
- Write a program that performs the following actions:
  - input data from the keyboard into an array of eight elements of type `Train` (records must be sorted by train numbers);
  - display information about a train whose number is entered from the keyboard (if there are no such trains, display an appropriate message).

## Task 3

Create a class `MyClass` and a structure `MyStruct`, both containing a field `public string change`.

In the `Program` class, create two methods:
- `static void ClassTaker(MyClass myClass)`, which assigns the value "changed" to the `change` field of the `myClass` instance.
- `static void StructTaker(MyStruct myStruct)`, which assigns the value "changed" to the `change` field of the `myStruct` instance.

Demonstrate the difference between using classes and structures by creating instances of both in the `Main()` method. Change the field values of the instances to "not changed", then call the `ClassTaker` and `StructTaker` methods. Display the field values of the instances on the screen. Analyze the results.

## Task 4

Visit the MSDN website. Using MSDN's search mechanisms, find descriptions of the topics for each example discussed in the lesson, as shown below in the "Recommended Resources" section of the lesson descriptions. Save the links and provide a brief description for each.

## Task 5

Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template.

Create a structure named `Notebook` with the following fields:
- model,
- manufacturer,
- price.

The structure should have a constructor to initialize the fields and a method to display the field contents on the screen.
